# lead_scoring_case_study
1. Business Problem:
X Education sells online courses to industry professionals who are interested in the courses. They land on their website and browse for courses. They market their courses on several websites and search engines like Google. When customers land on the website, they might browse the courses, fill out a form for the course, or watch some videos. Once these leads are acquired, employees from the sales team start making calls, writing emails, etc.
Through this process, some of the leads get converted, while most do not. The typical lead conversion rate at X Education is around 30%. Although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. They acquire 100 leads in a day, but only about 30 of them are converted.
2. Analysis Objectives:
X Education has appointed you to help them select the most promising leads, i.e., the leads that are most likely to convert into paying customers.
The company requires you to build a model wherein you need to assign a lead score to each of the leads such that the customers with a higher lead score have a higher conversion chance and the customers with a lower lead score have a lower conversion chance. The CEO, in particular, has given a ballpark estimate of the target lead conversion rate at around 80%.
